It's a lib to make simple graphical installer using rust and egui



Do not use for now, it's far from done

A rly basic example can be found at `src\main.rs`
The example downloads the release 1.3 of my `Lumin` project in the project root + /downloads, feel free to delete the directory after. (Just wanted to try how would it work with real files)
